CRUDs is a comprehensive project built with Vanilla JavaScript. It deals with the DOM and performs all CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete, and Search.

The project allows users to add new data, browse existing data, update current data, delete data, and search for data based on specific criteria.

It uses pure JavaScript without the use of any libraries or frameworks, relying on DOM principles to interact with the page and update data.
